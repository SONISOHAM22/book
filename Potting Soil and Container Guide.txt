Container Selection Guide
Terracotta Pots
Advantages:

Porous material allows soil to breathe
Excellent for plants prone to overwatering
Provides stability for top-heavy plants

Disadvantages:

Dries out quickly, requiring more frequent watering
Can develop mineral deposits and discoloration
Heavier than plastic options

Plastic Pots
Advantages:

Lightweight and inexpensive
Retains moisture longer
Available in many sizes and colors
Doesn't break easily

Disadvantages:

Less breathable, can promote soggy soil
Can become brittle over time with sun exposure

Less environmentally friendly unless recycled

Best for: Moisture-loving plants, ferns, calatheas, and plants needing consistent moisture
Ceramic Glazed Pots
Advantages:

Decorative with many design options
Less porous than terracotta when glazed
Good moisture retention
Provides stability

Disadvantages:

Heavy and can be expensive
Often lacks drainage holes (drill carefully or use as cachepot)
Can chip or crack if dropped
Non-breathable glazed surface

Best for: Display plants, medium water-need plants, when using as decorative cover pot
Self-Watering Containers
Advantages:

Provides consistent moisture
Reduces watering frequency
Good for vacation periods
Can prevent overwatering if used correctly

Disadvantages:

Can promote root rot if reservoir isn't managed properly
More expensive than basic containers
May be complicated for beginners
Not suitable for drought-loving plants

Best for: Consistent moisture-lovers, busy plant owners, plants in hard-to-reach locations
Hanging Baskets
Advantages:

Maximizes space
Showcases trailing plants
Keeps plants away from pets/children
Creates vertical interest

Disadvantages:

Dries out quickly due to air exposure
Can be difficult to water thoroughly
Weight limitations
May drip when watered

Best for: Trailing plants like pothos, spider plants, string of pearls, ivy
Fabric Pots
Advantages:

Excellent air pruning of roots
Prevents root circling
Good drainage
Lightweight and often foldable

Disadvantages:

Dries out quickly
Less decorative unless covered
Can develop mold in high humidity
May leak when watered

Best for: Root vegetables (if growing edibles), plants needing excellent drainage, plants prone to becoming root-bound
Drainage Considerations
Proper Drainage Techniques

Always use pots with drainage holes

Minimum one hole at least 1/4" diameter
Multiple smaller holes provide better drainage
For DIY drainage, use diamond drill bit on ceramic/glass


Elevation methods

Use pot feet to raise containers
Place small rocks between pot and saucer
Ensure water can flow freely from drainage holes


Drainage layers

Modern recommendation: Avoid gravel/rocks in bottom (creates perched water table)
Better alternative: Use consistent soil mix throughout
For extremely moisture-sensitive plants, bottom 10% can be pure perlite


Saucer management

Empty saucers within 30 minutes after watering
Use saucers slightly larger than pot diameter
Consider absorbent saucer materials for small pots



Working with Decorative Pots Without Drainage

Double-potting method

Keep plant in plastic nursery pot with drainage
Place nursery pot inside decorative pot
Remove for watering and allow to drain completely
Use pebbles in decorative pot to prevent sitting in water


Creating a reservoir system

Place 1-2" of pebbles in bottom of decorative pot
Add activated charcoal layer (prevents bacteria/odors)
Place fabric barrier between rocks and soil
Monitor closely to prevent water reaching soil level



Pot Sizing Guidelines
General Pot Size Rules

When repotting, increase diameter by 1-2" maximum
Choose pots with similar depth to width for most plants
For root vegetables or tuber plants, use deeper containers
Consider mature plant size, not just current size

Sizing by Plant Type
Small (4-6" pots):

Most succulents and cacti
Small ferns
Starter plants and propagations
Small trailing plants (can be upgraded as they grow)

Medium (8-10" pots):

Pothos and philodendrons
Peace lilies
Medium-sized ferns
Snake plants (for contained growth)
Most herb plants

Large (12" and up):

Fiddle leaf figs
Mature monstera
Large snake plants
Bird of paradise
Floor plants
Statement specimens

Signs a Plant Needs Repotting

Roots circling visibly at bottom of pot
Roots growing out of drainage holes
Water runs straight through without being absorbed
Plant dries out extremely quickly (1-2 days)
Growth has significantly slowed despite good conditions
Plant appears top-heavy or unstable
Soil level has decreased significantly

Soil Amendments and Enhancers
Common Soil Amendments
Perlite:

Volcanic glass that appears as white specks
Creates air pockets in soil
Does not decompose or compact
Excellent for improving drainage
Sterile and pH neutral

Vermiculite:

Mineral that holds moisture while remaining light
Helps retain nutrients in soil
Good for seedlings and moisture-loving plants
Slightly alkaline pH
Compacts over time

Pumice:

Volcanic rock lighter than perlite
Doesn't float to top of soil like perlite
Very long-lasting aeration
pH neutral
Excellent for succulent mixes

Orchid Bark:

Provides excellent drainage and aeration
Decomposes slowly (1-2 years)
Creates air pockets for root health
Slightly acidic pH
Essential for epiphytic plants

Coco Coir:

Sustainable alternative to peat moss
Excellent water retention
Renewable resource
pH neutral
Decomposes very slowly

Activated Charcoal:

Removes impurities and odors
Discourages bacterial growth
Long-lasting in soil
Essential for terrariums and closed systems
Used sparingly (5-10% of mix)
