Indoor Plants Watering Schedule
Drought-Tolerant Plants (Water every 2-3 weeks)

Snake Plant (Sansevieria): Allow soil to dry completely between waterings. During winter, reduce to once monthly. Signs of overwatering include soft, mushy leaves and yellowing; underwatering shows as wrinkling or curling leaves.
ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia): Can go 3-4 weeks between waterings. Extremely drought tolerant due to rhizomes that store water. Overwatering causes yellowing leaves and potential root rot; rare signs of underwatering include slightly wrinkled leaves.
Succulents (Echeveria, Haworthia, etc.): Water thoroughly but infrequently, allowing soil to completely dry out. In winter, reduce to once monthly. Overwatering causes translucent, mushy leaves; underwatering shows as shriveled, dried leaves.

Medium Water Needs (Water every 7-10 days)

Pothos (Epipremnum aureum): Allow top 1-2 inches of soil to dry between waterings. Overwatering causes yellowing leaves and root rot; underwatering shows as wilting and brown leaf edges.
Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum): Water when top inch of soil feels dry. Overwatering causes root rot and brown spots; underwatering shows as pale, limp leaves.
Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum): Keep soil consistently moist but not soggy. Very communicative plant that dramatically droops when thirsty but rebounds quickly after watering. Overwatering causes yellowing leaves; underwatering shows as dramatic wilting.
Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica): Allow top 2 inches of soil to dry between waterings. Overwatering causes leaf drop and yellowing; underwatering leads to brown leaf edges and leaf drop.

Moisture-Loving Plants (Water every 3-5 days)

Ferns (Boston, Maidenhair, etc.): Keep soil consistently moist. Particularly sensitive to dry air. Overwatering causes yellowing fronds; underwatering shows as brown, crispy fronds.
Prayer Plant (Maranta): Keep soil evenly moist. Prefer high humidity. Overwatering causes leaf spot diseases; underwatering shows as curling leaves that don't unfold at night.
Calathea varieties: Keep soil consistently moist but not soggy. Highly sensitive to both over and underwatering. Overwatering causes fungal issues; underwatering shows as curling, crisping leaf edges.

Seasonal Adjustments

Spring/Summer: Increase watering frequency by 25-50% during active growth periods.
Fall/Winter: Reduce watering by 25-50% during dormant periods as plants need less water.
Always adjust based on environmental factors: Plants will need more frequent watering in:

Higher temperatures
Lower humidity environments
Brighter light conditions
Smaller pots



Watering Techniques

Bottom watering: Place pot in a tray of water for 20-30 minutes, allowing soil to absorb moisture from the bottom drainage holes. Excellent for preventing overwatering.
Shower method: Place tropical plants in the shower for a thorough rinse monthly, which cleans leaves and deeply hydrates soil.
Ice cube method (NOT recommended): Though popular for orchids, this method can shock roots and provides inadequate moisture distribution.

Testing Soil Moisture

Finger test: Insert finger 1-2 inches into soil; if dry at this depth, most medium-water plants need watering.
Wooden skewer test: Insert a wooden skewer to the bottom of the pot; if it comes out clean, soil is dry enough for watering.
Moisture meter: Most accurate method for precise readings, especially for larger pots where finger test is inadequate.

Remember: It's always better to underwater than overwater. Most houseplants can recover from drought stress, but root rot from overwatering is often fatal.
