Plant Light Requirements
Bright Direct Light (6+ hours of direct sunlight)
These plants thrive in south or west-facing windows with unobstructed sunlight.
Plants That Need Bright Direct Light:

Succulents (Echeveria, Crassula, etc.): Place within 1-2 feet of south-facing windows. Rotate every few weeks to maintain even growth. In insufficient light, succulents become elongated and "stretched" (etiolated).
Cacti: Require the brightest conditions in the home. Position directly in south-facing windows. Without adequate light, new growth becomes thin and pale.
Citrus Plants: Need maximum indoor light. Place directly in sunniest window available. In winter, may require supplemental grow lights to maintain health.
Croton (Codiaeum variegatum): Requires bright light to maintain vibrant foliage colors. Without adequate light, new leaves will be predominantly green with minimal variegation.
Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata): Though often marketed as medium-light plants, they perform best with 4-6 hours of direct morning sun. East or south-facing window placement is ideal.

Bright Indirect Light (Bright but filtered sunlight)
These plants do best near bright windows with sheer curtains or slightly away from direct sun exposure.
Plants That Need Bright Indirect Light:

Monstera deliciosa: Position 3-5 feet from south-facing windows or directly in east-facing windows. Without sufficient light, new leaves will lack characteristic splits and holes (fenestrations).
Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica): Place near east or west-facing windows. Can tolerate some direct morning sun but avoid harsh afternoon exposure. In low light, spacing between leaves increases dramatically.
Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia): Position near south or west-facing windows with some protection from the harshest midday sun. Requires bright light to flower indoors (though flowering indoors is rare).
Philodendron varieties: Most thrive 3-4 feet from bright windows. Climbing varieties like Brasil or Heartleaf can tolerate slightly lower light than upright varieties like Congo.
Pothos (Epipremnum aureum): Highly adaptable but shows best variegation in bright indirect light. Golden Pothos and Marble Queen require brighter conditions than solid green varieties to maintain variegation.

Medium Light (No direct sun but still bright enough to cast a shadow)
These plants succeed in east-facing windows or several feet away from brighter exposures.
Plants That Thrive in Medium Light:

Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum): Position in east-facing windows or 6-8 feet from south-facing windows. Will only flower with adequate lightâ€”lack of blooms often indicates insufficient light levels.
Chinese Evergreen (Aglaonema): Very adaptable but variegated varieties need more light than solid green types. Place 5-7 feet from bright windows for optimal growth.
Dracaena varieties: Can adapt to medium light conditions. Place 4-6 feet from bright windows. Red-edged varieties like Dracaena marginata need brighter conditions to maintain coloration.
Snake Plant (Sansevieria): Highly adaptable but grows faster in brighter spots. Can be placed up to 8-10 feet from windows but growth will be significantly slower.
ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia): Thrives in medium light conditions. Position 5-8 feet from bright windows. Growth will be extremely slow in lower light conditions.

Low Light (Areas away from windows but still bright enough to read)
These plants survive in north-facing windows or interior spaces with minimal natural light.
Plants That Can Survive in Low Light:

Cast Iron Plant (Aspidistra elatior): One of the most shade-tolerant houseplants. Can be placed in north-facing windows or up to 10 feet from east/west exposures.
Pothos (solid green varieties): Golden Pothos will revert to solid green in low light but continue to grow. Can survive 10-12 feet from light sources.
Snake Plant (Sansevieria): While growth slows dramatically, they survive in low light areas up to 12 feet from windows.
ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia): Can survive in office environments with only fluorescent lighting. Growth will be minimal but plant remains healthy.
Parlor Palm (Chamaedorea elegans): One of few palms that tolerate low light. Position in north-facing windows or hallways with ambient light.

Light Placement Tips
Understanding Your Home's Exposure:

South-facing windows: Receive the most intense, direct light (northern hemisphere)
East-facing windows: Morning sun, gentler and ideal for many tropical plants
West-facing windows: Afternoon sun, often hotter and more intense than morning light
North-facing windows: Lowest light levels, suitable only for true low-light plants

Enhancing Available Light:

Use mirrors to reflect light deeper into rooms
Clean windows regularly to maximize light transmission (can increase light by up to 30%)
Trim outdoor foliage that may be blocking windows
Consider supplemental grow lights for plants showing light-deficiency symptoms

Seasonal Adjustments:

Winter: Move plants 20-30% closer to windows as light intensity decreases
Summer: Pull sensitive plants back from windows to prevent leaf burn during peak sunlight
Rotate plants 1/4 turn weekly to ensure even growth on all sides

Signs of Improper Light Levels:

Too much light: Scorched/bleached leaves, dried leaf edges, wilting despite adequate water
Too little light: Leggy growth, small new leaves, loss of variegation, reaching toward light sources
