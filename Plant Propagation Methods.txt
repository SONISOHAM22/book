Plant Propagation Methods
Water Propagation
Stem Cuttings in Water
This is my preferred method for most vining and trailing plants due to its simplicity and the satisfaction of watching roots develop.
Plants That Root Easily in Water:

Pothos (Epipremnum): Take 4-6" cuttings with 2-3 nodes. Remove lower leaves. Roots appear in 7-14 days. My success rate: 95%
Philodendron: Similar to pothos, with even faster rooting (5-10 days). Include at least one node per cutting. My success rate: 98%
Monstera deliciosa: Cut below a node with an aerial root if possible. Roots develop in 2-3 weeks. My success rate: 85%
Spider Plant (Chlorophytum): Use the plantlets/babies that hang from mother plant. Roots often already present. My success rate: 100%
Tradescantia/Wandering Dude: Extremely easy—roots develop in 2-5 days from any stem section with a node. My success rate: 100%

My Water Propagation Process:

Use clean scissors/pruners sterilized with alcohol
Make cuts just below nodes at a 45° angle
Remove leaves from lower 1-2 nodes that will be submerged
Place in clear glass containers (I prefer narrow-necked bottles to support the cutting)
Use room temperature filtered water or rainwater
Place in bright indirect light, never direct sun
Change water every 5-7 days to prevent algae growth
Wait until roots are 2-3" long before potting up
When potting, use light, well-draining soil mix and keep more consistently moist for first 2 weeks

Personal Tips:

Adding a drop of liquid seaweed fertilizer to water can expedite rooting
Rooting is generally faster in warmer temperatures (75-80°F)
I've had better success with opaque containers for plants like monstera and fiddle leaf fig
Failures: ZZ plants and succulents consistently rotted for me in water—use soil propagation instead

Soil Propagation
Direct Soil Cuttings
Better for plants prone to rot in water and those that benefit from rooting hormone.
Plants Best Propagated Directly in Soil:

Snake Plant (Sansevieria): Cut leaf into 3-4" sections, ensuring you maintain proper leaf orientation (same end up as was growing). Let cuttings callus 24-48 hours before planting. Rooting time: 4-8 weeks. My success rate: 80%
ZZ Plant: Leaf cuttings take months but eventually produce tubers. Stem cuttings with 2-3 leaflets work better. Rooting time: 2-3 months. My success rate: 75%
Succulents: Allow cut ends to callus 24-72 hours before placing on well-draining cactus soil. Barely moisten soil until roots establish. My success rate: 90%
Peperomia: Leaf cuttings with small portion of stem attached. Keep soil barely moist. Rooting time: 3-4 weeks. My success rate: 85%
Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata): Stem cuttings with 1-2 leaves, treated with rooting hormone. Keep humidity high. Rooting time: 4-6 weeks. My success rate: 70%

My Soil Propagation Process:

Prepare well-draining propagation mix (50% perlite, 50% regular potting soil)
For most plants, dip cut end in rooting hormone powder
Create hole in soil with pencil to avoid rubbing off hormone
Keep soil just barely moist, never soggy
Create mini-greenhouse effect with clear plastic bag or cut plastic bottle
Place in bright indirect light
Remove covering gradually once new growth appears

Personal Tips:

Using bottom heat (seedling mat) increases success rate significantly
For cuttings prone to rot, mix cinnamon into soil as natural fungicide
Failures: Multiple attempts at African violet leaf propagation produced roots but no new plants

Division Propagation
Root Division
Ideal for plants that naturally produce offshoots or have multiple growth points.
Plants Easily Propagated by Division:

Snake Plant: Separate offshoots with roots attached during repotting. Let divisions dry 24 hours before replanting. My success rate: 100%
Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum): Gently separate clumps when repotting, ensuring each division has adequate roots. My success rate: 95%
Calathea/Prayer Plants: Divide at natural separation points when roots have filled pot. My success rate: 85%
Chinese Evergreen (Aglaonema): Separate basal offshoots with roots during repotting. My success rate: 90%
Aloe and Haworthia: Remove pups that form around base when they're at least 1/5 size of mother plant. Let callus before replanting. My success rate: 95%

My Division Process:

Water plant thoroughly 24 hours before dividing
Remove plant from pot and gently remove soil around roots
Identify natural separation points
Use clean knife for tougher root masses
Ensure each division has adequate roots and growth points
Allow cuts to callus for several hours for succulent-type plants
Repot divisions in appropriate-sized containers
Keep divisions in slightly higher humidity for 2 weeks

Personal Tips:

Spring is optimal timing for most divisions
Root pruning by 1/3 when dividing promotes fresh root growth
Failures: Dividing maiden hair fern resulted in both sections dying—now I only divide very established specimens

Leaf Propagation
Leaf Cuttings and Plantlets
Works for plants that can generate new growth points from leaf tissue.
Plants Propagatable from Leaves:

African Violet: Cut leaf with 1-2" stem, plant stem at 45° angle. New plants emerge from base in 6-8 weeks. My success rate: 60%
Begonia rex: Take leaf cuttings and either lay flat on soil with cuts in veins or cut into triangles with vein in each piece. Keep humid. My success rate: 75%
Succulent Leaves: Allow leaf to callus, then lay on soil. Don't bury. Tiny plants form at leaf base in 2-4 weeks. My success rate: 85%
Streptocarpus: Cut leaf perpendicular to main vein into 1" strips. Plant edge in soil. New plants form in 4-6 weeks. My success rate: 70%
Sansevieria: Leaf sections as described in soil propagation section

My Leaf Propagation Process:

Select healthy, mature leaves
For most (except succulents), use rooting hormone on cut surface
Place in propagation medium (lightweight mix or 50/50 perlite/peat)
Maintain high humidity with plastic covering
Provide bright, indirect light
Keep soil barely moist
Be patient—leaf propagation often takes longer than other methods

Personal Tips:

Success rates improve dramatically with bottom heat
For Begonia propagation, I've had better results with leaf pieces in shallow water until plantlets form
Failures: Attempted leaf propagation with Monstera deliciosa (requires stem tissue)

Air Layering
For Difficult-to-Root Plants
Excellent for plants with thicker stems that are challenging to propagate by cuttings.
Plants Well-Suited to Air Layering:

Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata): Creates a nearly guaranteed successful propagation. My success rate: 95%
Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica): Excellent results with minimal risk. My success rate: 90%
Monstera deliciosa: Works well for larger specimens. My success rate: 85%
Dieffenbachia: Good solution for leggy plants. My success rate: 80%
Dracaena marginata: Effective for creating shorter plants from tall specimens. My success rate: 85%

My Air Layering Process:

Identify point on stem for propagation (usually 8-12" from top)
Make 1" angled cut upward into stem, about 1/3 through diameter
Insert toothpick to keep cut open
Apply rooting hormone to exposed inner tissue
Pack damp sphagnum moss around cut, about tennis ball sized amount
Wrap with plastic wrap and secure with twist ties above and below
Keep moss damp by injecting water with syringe as needed
Once roots are visible through moss (4-8 weeks), cut below root ball and pot

Personal Tips:

Using clear plastic allows monitoring root development
For ficus plants, removing a 1/2" ring of bark (girdling) works better than a single cut
Adding a small amount of activated charcoal to moss prevents bacterial growth
Failures: Attempted air layering on woody herbs was unsuccessful

Specialized Propagation
Rhizome and Tuber Division
For plants that grow from specialized storage structures.
Plants Propagated from Rhizomes/Tubers:

ZZ Plant: Rhizome division during repotting. Ensure each division has stems and roots. My success rate: 90%
Prayer Plant (Maranta): Rhizome division, keeping several growth points per section. My success rate: 85%
Alocasia: Corm separation from main plant. Plant in moist soil at shallow depth. My success rate: 70%
Calla Lily: Rhizome division when dormant. My success rate: 90%
Caladium: Tuber division with at least one eye per section. My success rate: 85%

My Rhizome Division Process:

Best performed during natural dormancy or slow growth periods
Ensure each division has at least one growth point/eye
Allow cuts to callus for several hours before replanting
Plant at appropriate depth (generally similar to original depth)
Water sparingly until new growth appears

Personal Tips:

Dusting cut surfaces with sulfur helps prevent rot
For ZZ plants, even a small piece of rhizome can eventually produce a new plant
Failures: Splitting alocasia rhizomes too small resulted in rot—divisions should be substantial
